LazyNotes
A music instrument for the mouse
(Because you're too lazy to play a real instrument)

Made during the Monthly Music Hackathon NYC (August 31st, 2013)

- Uses the WebAudio API (so make sure your browser supports that)
- Uses jCanvas (http://calebevans.me/projects/jcanvas/)

Feel free to do whatever you want with it!
